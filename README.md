#BattleTanks
BattleTanks is a small Python project using Pygame.
##Installation
###Linux
Open up a terminal and type `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip git`. Once the installation has finished, run `git clone https://github.com/JellyWX/BattleTanks.git`. It should create a folder called `~/BattleTanks/`. Run `sudo pip3 install pygame` to install pygame and then `cd` into the folder. Use `python3 main.py` to run.
####Mac
For Mac, the process above *should* work, but you'll need to change the `apt` to the mac package manager.

###Windows
Unfortunately, its a little harder for Windows users.

Go online and download `python3` from the official website. Run the installer and make sure it gets appended to the path. Open a CMD and run `python` to check. It should open what appears as another command line prepended with `>>>` and say that python is running. Open a console as administrator (how you do this I don't know) and run `pip3 install pygame`. It will install pygame. Now, download the entire source of this project and unzip it. `cd` through to the directory in your console and run `python main.py`.
